<h3><p align="center">philza kinnie moment</p></h3>

<p align="center">Preferred duo/group c+h: EmeraldDuo (comf dynamic, queerplatonic?), Angel Duo (comf, familial), Bedrock Bros (comf dynamic, platonic/familial), Peer Pressure Duo (comf dynamic, platonic), Anarchist Syndicate, Doomsday Trio, Rivals Duo.</p>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, Ranboo, Sneeg, Mumza/Kristin, Tubbo, Wilbur, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. EmeraldDuo is not just platonic to me, it feels very queerplatonic (coming from someone who has been in a QPR in the past). Ppl who see Techno as Phil's kid IWC. They are friends, not related. I like SBI only when it's portrayed as EmeraldDuo + their kids.</p>
<p align="center">Forewarning, Phil (combination of both c!phil and cc!phil) is sensitive, gets easily attached, and is kind/affectionate even with people he doesn't know well. Has very fond memories of Techno, Sneeg, Tommy, and Ranboo. Goes gremlin crow brain sometimes and can only think about collecting shiny things (e.g. cc!phil's origins behavior "am bird, I see shiny. can I has").</p>
<p align="center">My inchboy Sneegsnag pony is a comf for cuddling Philzas with, in this skin I wanna int/c+h with any of the Origins SMP people (Techno, Smajor, Niki, Jack, Ranboo, Tubbo, etc!) but mainly Phil. No ships pls.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Technoblade skins (dsmp, origins), I'm open to sitting with Philza (EMERALDDUO PLEASE), Tommy (Techno is like his older brother/father figure), Ranboo (Techno is protective of him), Niki, Skeppy (ILY/p), Dream (NERRRRD), Quackity (I'm not scary I promise), Wilbur, or anyone else Technoblade knows.</p>
<p align="center">Techno is chill with everyone unless they treat him poorly first. Probably aroace, but can be affectionate, rarely. The only person he allows to call him Tech are Phils he's familiar with, anyone else saying that nickname is weird to him. Protective of Ranboo, less protective of Tommy but cares about him. Bullies people affectionately or for fun.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Tommy skin, Techno is a HUGE comfort to him and he's protective of the Phil in this system. DREAM DO NOT APPROACH ME I WILL SLAP YOU /j (actually idfc as long as you're not a dick). Techno and Philza and Wilbur and Tubbo and Ranboo and Mumbo Jumbo and Grian and stuff definitely int please :D</p>
<p align="center">Tommy often dissociates and needs the comfort of music (e.g. listening to the discs) to stay focused. He also gets clingy with people he feels safe with, but takes a while to trust people. Has conflicted opinion of Dream, may act aggressive (nonseriously ofc) toward anyone in a skin of him to feel comfortable around them.</p>

<p align="center">I do not support any creators I don't know enough about (nwss, but the casual "I just don't care about the cc at all" kind). Do not drag me into drama, I can guarantee you I am not informed enough to be in arguments of that nature. That being said, SUBSCRIBE TO TECHNOBLADEEEE</p>

<p align="center">I'm actually multifandom! While I am currently obsessed with Minecraft, I also enjoy Genshin Impact, CRK, Undertale, Deltarune, Stanley Parable, a few animes, Omori, HH/HB because of characters I kin in them but I don't support the creator and avoid most of the fanbase, HSR before amphoreus, and older fandoms like Marvel, LOTR and Star Wars.</p>
