<h3><p align="center">philza kinnie moment</p></h3>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, Wilbur, Tubbo, Ranboo, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. I ship emeraldduo in every way possible privately but I don't mind sitting as platonic emeraldduo too! I just think it's at least queerplatonic canonically.</p>
<p align="center">Forewarning, Phil gets easily attached and likes being affectionate. It's probably a coping mechanism from being separated from everyone he has memories of.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Technoblade skin, I'm open to sitting with Philza (EMERALDDUO PLEASE), Tommy, Ranboo, Niki, Skeppy (I might troll you affectionately), Dream (I will poke fun at you but it's never serious dw), Quackity (I may bully you a little for funsies), or anyone else Technoblade knows. I'm open to Technoblade ships beyond emduo.</p>
<p align="center">Techno is chill with everyone unless they treat him poorly first. Bullies people affectionately or for fun, never serious. That's just how he makes friends.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Tommy skin, Techno is a HUGE comfort and Phil is dad. DREAM DO NOT APPROACH ME I WILL SLAP YOU /hj (actually idfc as long as you're not a dick). SBI and Tubbo and Ranboo and Mumbo Jumbo and Grian and stuff definitely int please :D</p>
<p align="center">Tommy often dissociates and needs the comfort of music (e.g. listening to the discs) to stay focused. He also gets clingy with people he feels safe with, but takes a while to trust people.</p>
