<h3><p align="center">philza kinnie moment</p></h3>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, Wilbur, Tubbo, Ranboo, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. I ship emeraldduo in every way possible privately but I don't mind sitting as platonic emeraldduo too! I just think it's at least queerplatonic canonically.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Technoblade skin, I'm open to sitting with Philza (EMERALDDUO PLEASE), Tommy, Ranboo, Niki, Skeppy (I might troll you affectionately), Dream (I will poke fun at you but it's never serious dw), Quackity (I may bully you a little for funsies), or anyone else Technoblade knows. I'm open to Technoblade ships beyond emduo.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Tommy skin, Techno is a comf and Phil is dad. DREAM DO NOT FUCKING INT I WILL SLAP YOU /hj (actually idfc as long as you're not a dick). SBI and Tubbo and Ranboo and stuff definitely int please :D</p>
