<h3><p align="center">philza kinnie moment</p></h3>

<p align="center">Preferred duo/group c+h: EmeraldDuo (comf dynamic, queerplatonic?), Anarchist Syndicate, Bedrock Bros (comf dynamic, platonic/familial), Doomsday Trio, Rivals Duo. Disc Duo is on thin ice PLEASE be normal and not a creep.</p>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, (nwss)Wilbur, Sneeg, Tubbo, Ranboo, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. EmeraldDuo is not just platonic to me, it feels very queerplatonic (coming from someone who has been in a QPR in the past). Ppl who see Techno as Phil's kid DO NOT talk to me, for both my comfort and yours. They are friends, not related, and Technoblade himself before he passed did not like being seen as Phil's kid.</p>
<p align="center">Forewarning, Phil gets easily attached and is kind/affectionate even with people he doesn't know well. Finds huge comfort in Techno, unwaveringly loyal and affectionate toward him.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Technoblade skins (dsmp, origins), I'm open to sitting with Philza (EMERALDDUO PLEASE), Tommy (Techno is like his older brother/father figure), Ranboo (Techno is protective of him), Niki, Skeppy (ILY/p), Dream (NERRRRD), Quackity (I'm not scary I promise), Wilbur, or anyone else Technoblade knows.</p>
<p align="center">Techno is chill with everyone unless they treat him poorly first. Probably aroace, but can be affectionate, rarely. Protective of Ranboo, less protective of Tommy but cares about him. Bullies people affectionately or for fun.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Tommy skin, Techno is a HUGE comfort and he's protective of the Phil in this system. DREAM DO NOT APPROACH ME I WILL SLAP YOU /hj (actually idfc as long as you're not a dick). Techno and Philza and (nwss)Wilbur and Tubbo and Ranboo and Mumbo Jumbo and Grian and stuff definitely int please :D</p>
<p align="center">Tommy often dissociates and needs the comfort of music (e.g. listening to the discs) to stay focused. He also gets clingy with people he feels safe with, but takes a while to trust people.</p>

<p align="center">Schlatt doesn't really use this account, but is here nonetheless. Protective of the Phil in this system.</p>
