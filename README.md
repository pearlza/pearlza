<h3><p align="center">philza kinnie moment</p></h3>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, Wilbur, Tubbo, Ranboo, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. I ship emeraldduo in every way possible privately but I don't mind sitting as platonic emeraldduo too! I just think it's at least queerplatonic canonically.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Technoblade skin, I'm open to sitting with Philza (EMERALDDUO PLEASE), Tommy, Ranboo, Niki, Tubbo, Wilbur, Skeppy, Dream, Quackity (I may bully you a little for funsies), Schlatt, or anyone else Technoblade knows. I'm open to Technoblade ships beyond emduo.</p>

<p align="center">I do not support cc!dream or cc!wilbur they both suck btw</p>

<p align="center">Since someone decided to accuse me of being racist after digging through an old dni, the context is I don't like RCTA, either irl or people doing it to fictional characters. Natural rep like a cc!'s actual race, e.g. Quackity being spanish, should take precedence over making characters something they're not. The dni was for an old fandom and I haven't touched it in a while. Might rewrite it soon since people are getting pissed off at my poor wording again.</p>
