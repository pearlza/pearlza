<h3><p align="center">philza kinnie moment</p></h3>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Philza skin, I'm open to sitting with Technoblade (PLEASE PLEASE EMERALDDUO I NEED IT), Tommy, Wilbur, Tubbo, Ranboo, Niki, anyone Philza knows basically. I ship emeraldduo in every way possible privately but I don't mind sitting as platonic emeraldduo too! I just think it's at least queerplatonic canonically.</p>
<p align="center">If I'm in my Technoblade skin, I'm open to sitting with Philza (EMERALDDUO PLEASE), Tommy, Ranboo, Niki, Tubbo, Wilbur, Skeppy, Dream, Quackity (I may bully you a little for funsies), Schlatt, or anyone else Technoblade knows. I'm open to Technoblade ships beyond emduo.</p>

<p align="center">If I'm in my Tommy skin, DREAM DO NOT FUCKING INT I WILL SLAP YOU. SBI and Tubbo and Ranboo and stuff can int :D</p>

<p align="center">I do not support cc!dream or cc!wilbur they both suck btw</p>
